# frogger-game
Tried making a copy of the retro-game called Frogger. Play it at https://ibtehajdoesdevelopment.on.drv.tw/webdev/games/frogger/.

The game is made on a 16x12 grid, hence making all elements move one step at a time. In addition, this game requires a keyboard to play, hence the webpage is not responsive to fit mobile screen sizes.

This game was a part of the tutorial course given by Ania Kubow on the Free Code Camp YouTube channel.

Ideas on Improvement:

1. Another car can be launched on the road after one has already crossed halfway through, but since the car speeds are determined randomly, additional code must be written to make the car stop if it sees something ahead of it. This can certainly be doen, however, it would make the game even more dizzying, per the feedback I've got thus far.
