# frogger-game
Tried making a copy of the retro-game called Frogger. Play it at https://ibtehajdoesdevelopment.on.drv.tw/webdev/Games/Frogger/.

The game is made on a 16x12 grid, hence making all elements move one step at a time.

This game was a part of the tutorial course given by Ania Kubow on the Free Code Camp YouTube channel.
